# Shikiji-theme-editor

我想给水墨加一个代码主题，
但是我发现theme相当晦涩，并且如果`clone`一个主题，替换全部颜色的话，某些个性化的需求也会比较难以实现。
因此我写了一个小工具，以简化theme的编辑，
当然他存在相当多的不足，我会慢慢完善的。


I want to add a code theme to `Shuimo Design`,
However, I find that the theme is quite obscure,
and if you clone a theme and replace all colors, 
it will be difficult to achieve certain personalized needs.
So I wrote a small tool to simplify theme editing.
Of course, it has quite a few shortcomings, and I will gradually improve them.
